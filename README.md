BatchMan& Robby is a Simple CD with a .bat file and a .inf file
The .bat file is the BinaryBomb, a Stupid Virus of my creation, written in Batch Script for the fun
and the .inf file which serves to start automatically the BinaryBomb
you have to burn it to CD or DVD as a data disc
THE CD starts immediately whit autorun function  (It can not work from Windows 7 up, on w10 only work if the autorun function is manually activated)
and crash the system.
you can not use the task manager,the only solution is to restart the pc.
Normally it is not detected by any antivirus
or at least those with whom I have tried it
(AVAST, MBAM, Reason Core, AVG)
however, if you own it detects
disable it prior to the victim machine
great for small jokes in the office (Where you often see computers with older operating systems)
or for piss off a few loser friends...
